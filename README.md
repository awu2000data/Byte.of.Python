The python source code I write to practice. I use the following tutorial book to learn Python.

"A Byte of Python"

http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/

"A Byte of Python" is a free book on programming using the Python language. 
It serves as a tutorial or guide to the Python language for a beginner 
audience. If all you know about computers is how to save text files, then 
this is the book for you.

This book is written for the latest Python 3, even though Python 2 is 
the commonly found version of Python today (read more about it in Python 
2 versus 3 section).
